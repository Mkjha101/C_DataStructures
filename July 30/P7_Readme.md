Aim= Decimal to Binary and Binary to Decimal Convertors.
<br>
Procedure:
<br>
Decimal to Binary Conversion
<ol>
<li>Taking any decimal number from user input.</li>
<li>Then taking its remainder by dividing the number by 2, and storing it into some new variable.</li>
<li>And in the meantime, replacing the number to the quotient, when divided by 2.</li>
<li>Repeating the same process as above till the number becomes 0.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, alongwith the above processes, adding the string of that new variable to previously made string. Or Adding the new variable after multiplying it with respective Place value, in case of integer variable.</li>
</ol>
<br>
Binary to Decimal Conversion
<ol>
<li>Taking every bit from the last of Binary String and multiplying with 2 raised to the power 'Index of String' and adding to some previously defined variable.</li>
<li>Finally, getting the Decimal representation of Binary number.</li>
</ol>
<br>
Output:
<br>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Input: 15</li>
<li>Binary representation of 15 is: 1111</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Decimal value of 1011 is: 11</li>
</ul>
</ul>
