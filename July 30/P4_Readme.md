Aim = Make an array b from the given array a of the same size from 1 to n such that b[i] contains the product of all elements of array a except the element a[i], present at that index. 
<br>
Algorithm:
<br>
<ol>
<li>First creating a new variable and storing the product of all the elements of the given array.</li>
<li>Now, start a loop from i=1 to the length of given array and store the product of all elements after dividing with the corresponding element of given array in a new array.</li>
</ol>
