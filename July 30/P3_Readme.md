Aim= To raise a <b>base</b>, <u>b</u> to some <b>exponent</b> <u>n</u> in less than <b>n</b> iterations.
<br>
Approach:
<br>
<ol>
<li>Input will be taken from user for the values of Base and Exponent both.</li>
<li>Then, we'll store the value of <b>Base</b> in other variable.</li>
<li>If, Exponent value is 0. Then Answer is 1 and count of iteration is 0.</li>
<li>Else, for non-zero Exponent, "one less than value of <b>Exponent</b>" iterations will be done to <b>multiply the base to the other variable. </></li>
<li>So, finally we'll get the answer of raising <b>Base</b> to <b>exponent</b>, <u>n</u></li>
<li>Meanwhile, number of iterations will also be counted.</li>
</ol>
<br>
Output:
<br>
Printing following:
<ul>
<li>Answer= Raising of Base to Exponent</li>
<li>Number of Iterations</li>
</ul>
