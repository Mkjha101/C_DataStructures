Aim= List of n given numbers in which we have to print 3 numbers such that a+b=c Algorithm =
<ol>
<li>First we have to take the input of n numbers in an array .</li>
<li>Then we will start the first loop from i= 1 to n .To select the first element of the array.</li>
<li>Now we will start the second loop from j= i+1 to n .To select the second element of the array.</li>
<li>Now we have to start the third loop from k = 1 to n .To check that whether the sum of the first and second element is equal to element of the array.</li>
<li>Now print the elements which allow the condition.</li><br> Output = Elements of which follow the condition.
</ul>
