Aim = We are given that a ball is falling on the ground with velocity v and at each bounce its velocity decreases by half. Then find the number of bounces.
<br>
Algorithm:
<br>
<ul>
<li>
First take the velocity as user input
</li>
<li>
Let the count be 0. And start the while until velocity is not 0.
</li>
<li>
In the loop increment the count as it measure the number of bounces and half the velocity.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
Output = The number of bounces which is equal to count.
